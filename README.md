Only one instance of this program can run at a time.

FixWindowsTimer.exe -> Adds the program path to startup and keeps the timer resolution at 0.5ms while running silently in the background. No manual clicking or setting the timer needed.

uninstallFixWindowsTimer.exe -> Removes program from startup.
